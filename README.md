## $\large\textsf{\color{#3a865b}{What is Faceit Stats Provider?}}$
Faceit Stats Provider is a web application that provides you with a set of useful statistics for your FACEIT account. It retrieves, analyzes, and generates various statistics that give you new insights into how you play.

## $\large\textsf{\color{#3a865b}{What are the features?}}$
**There are three main features that $\textsf{\color{#b14a30}{Faceit Stats Provider}}$ possesses:**

+ $$\large\textsf{\color{#c3a747}{Profile Overlay}}$$ 
  
    This is what you can see in the screenshot above. The Profile Overlay lets you view your overall statistics and stats from your last 20 matches on Faceit. You can look up common statistics regarding your play, such as average ADR, K/D, K/R, etc. It also provides features such as  **$\textsf{\color{#b14a30}{BALANCE}}$**, which displays how much elo you gained or lost within your last 20 games, and the  **$\textsf{\color{#b14a30}{MAX ELO}}$** feature, where you can see what your maximum cs
    and cs2 elo were. You can simply click on it, and it will redirect you to the game on Faceit where your max elo game was played. These two features are really simple but greatly enhance the user experience on the site.

    <br>
    
    **$\textsf{\color{#b14a30}{There are plenty of small details that, when combined, make the site so useful for users.}}$** For instance, you can filter matches to show only ranked games, 5v5 games, or  **$\textsf{\color{#b14a30}{OTHERS}}$**, which means you can also see 1v1 matches. Additionally, on this site and **$\textsf{\color{#b14a30}{only here, as far as I know}}$** you can also see walkover matches, which are matches that were never actually played. When the others filter is included, you can also see some special matches that were played on Faceit, such as BLAST matches. These are specially highlighted, so if you're a pro player, you can feel appreciated.

  **$\textsf{\color{#b14a30}{What makes this website stand out is that everything has been designed so that the user does not have to search for anything}}$**
   **$\textsf{\color{#b14a30}{and can make as few clicks as possible.}}$** 
  The search bar for the Profile Overlay also works as a Faceit account finder. You can paste a Steam profile link there to see if the given Steam account has a valid Faceit profile. Besides nicknames and Steam profiles, you can also insert a Faceit profile link to look up your stats.

  <br>
+ $$\large\textsf{\color{#c3a747}{Analyzer}}$$ 
 
    The Lobby Analyzer allows you to paste a lobby link when the match is found and analyze your enemy team to eventually find the best map against them. **$\textsf{\color{#b14a30}{It's quite a unique feature as it provides very detailed team statistics.}}$** You can        see the stats for the chosen team combined, as well as for every single map from the map pool. Besides that, you can even see what their stats are in the last 20 matches for every single map from the map pool.

    <br>

   Furthermore, I developed a special formula for calculating the best maps to play against your opponents, so people don't have to waste their time analyzing it themselves.

    <br>

    <br>
    
    For the exact explanation of the formula, we can head to the FAQ section. What is **$\textsf{\color{#b14a30}{innovative}}$** about this feature is that you can include or exclude cs
    stats from the calculations. This is really important since if you have a lobby of pro players, including cs
    stats can distort the data; suddenly, from 4k combined matches for the team, it goes up to 20k, resulting in different best map picks. I find this feature really cool since you can look up stats for teams from cs2, cs,
    or include both, which provides comfort for the user. **$\textsf{\color{#b14a30}{It's not the only thing that is innovative here.}}$**

    <br>
    
    What I find extremely **$\textsf{\color{#b14a30}{useful}}$** is that you can also exclude each individual player from the calculations. It's really helpful in situations when you play against a lobby where there is one pro player and four weaker players; sometimes pro players or generally good players can overstate team stats.

+ $$\large\textsf{\color{#c3a747}{Extension}}$$ 
  
  I also built an extension called [Faceit Position Caller](https://github.com/MAJDER0/Faceit-Position-Caller). It allows you to send messages into the match room right after a match is found, so you can be sure that you will be the first one to call your position on the map. You can send messages to general chat and team chat right after the match is found. Moreover, you can choose a message that you want to send for every map that is in the map pool, so when a map is picked, your message will be sent to team chat, general chat, or both, depending on what you select. **$\textsf{\color{#b14a30}{I am really proud of this extension since I find it a really original idea.}}$**

  <br>
  
  **$\large\textsf{\color{#ffcc4d}{However, for now it has to stay for private usage, as Faceit Developers don't provide the necessary}}$**
  **$\large\textsf{\color{#ffcc4d}{tools to dynamically add users to the webhook. If that does change, I will release it for public usage.}}$**
